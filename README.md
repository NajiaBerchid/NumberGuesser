# NumberGuesser
Number Guesser: it is not the funniest game in the world, but it gave me some experience with changing and keeping track of values, working with the DOM and structuring things in my app. I defined the guessing number between the range of 1 and 10.   GAME FUNCTION: - Player must guess a number between a min and max - Player gets a certain number of guesses - Notify player of guesses remaining - Notify the player of the correct answer if loose - Let player choose to play again
